# tele-foodbot

### Telegram bot for finding food
Bot name: @Foooodie_bot

Feel like eating something but unsure if the food is at the location you seek?
Simply type in foodie_bot to check if the food is at the place.

Easy to use:
- /start to start the bot
- /find {food, place}  
  > Note that the **comma** is important to differentiate the food and place

*A self-initiated project made for fun :)*
